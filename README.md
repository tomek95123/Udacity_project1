# Project motivation
In this project I am analysing Boston crimes dataset, which is available on www.kaggle.com. I was interested in using this dataset to find answears for the following questions:
1. What are the most common crimes commited in Boston and each Boston district?
2. What is the most dangerous district in Boston?
3. When most crimes are committed? What is the most dangerous time of a day, week, month?

# File descriptions
This repo contains two files:
1. 'crime.csv' - the dataset used for analysis. This dataset contains around 300k reported crimes in Boston. Each observation is a description of a crime commited in Boston. The dataset contains the following columns:
* INCIDENT_NUMBER
* OFFENSE_CODE
* OFFENSE_CODE_GROUP
*  OFFENSE_DESCRIPTION
*  DISTRICT
*  REPORTING_AREA
*  SHOOTING
*  OCCURRED_ON_DATE
*  YEAR
*  MONTH
*  DAY_OF_WEEK
*  HOUR
*  UCR_PART
*  STREET
*  LATITUDE
*  LONGITUDE
*  LOCATION

2. 'project_1.ipynb' - a file dedicated for the analysis of crime dataset. This file contains all neccessary explanations in the comments of what a given part of code is doing.
